<h3><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Background</span></h3>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a general
indicator reflecting the final results of production and business activities of
the economy in a given period.</span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Methodology</span></h3>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>There are three approaches to calculate Gross
Domestic Product: Production Approach, Expenditure Approach and Income
Approach.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Production Approach</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><br>
By Production Approach, GDP is the sum of value added of all industries plus
import tax on external material products and services. Value added of each
industry and each ownership is the gross output minus the value of intermediate
input of material products and services.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Expenditure Approach</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><br>
GDP calculated by Expenditure Approach or Expenditure on GDP is the sum of
three factors: Final consumption of households and the state, gross capital
formation (fixed asset, change in inventories and previous asset) and balance
of export and import of goods and services. There is a bit difference between
GDP calculated by product and expenditure approach and in database. Therefore,
there is statistical discrepancy.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Income Approach</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><br>
GDP calculated by Income Approach is sum of all income created by factors
distributed to process of production as labour, capital, land, machinery. GDP
includes (1) Compensation of employees (in cash and in kind); (2) Tax on
production; (3) Consumption of fixed capital; (4) Operating surplus.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Comparable Prices</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><br>
GDP is calculated at current and constant prices. GDP by current prices is used
to study the economic structure, the inter-industries relationship,
relationship between the production results and state budget mobilization. GDP
by constant prices removing the factor of price changes is used to calculate
the economic growth rate and to study the changes in goods and services
quantities.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Export and Import</span></b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><br>
In SNA, the export and import of goods and services are calculated at FOB,
excluding transport cost, goods insurance from the port of the destination to Vietnam.</span></p>

foreigners in Vietnam, and plus net property income from and to abroad.</span></p>

current prices and constant prices. The final consumption consists of final
consumption of households and final consumption of government.</span></p>

public consumption, due to different methodologies to deflate it and take it to
real values. The detailed methodology in Real and nominal terms are explained
below:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

provided on nominal consumption, disaggregated in salaries and goods and services
of the general government. This category includes the central government, government�s
local authorities and public institutions such as Regulatory Bodies, EsSalud,
the Office of Pension Standardization (ONP), Societies of Public Charity, the
National Fund for Public Savings (Fonahpu) and the Consolidated Reserve Fund
(FCR).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Gross Domestic Investment: The real levels
of the gross fixed investment of the public and private sectors are estimated.
The quarterly real private fixed gross investment is calculated by the asset

capital goods and domestic production of capital goods.</span></p>

and Services: The Paasche price indices estimated by the Central Bank are used
to calculate exports and real imports of non-financial goods and services. For
the current year and for those for which there is no information available from

of the exports and imports of non-financial goods and services were applied,
obtained with the methodology described on the levels of the last year published

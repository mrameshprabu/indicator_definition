<h2>United States: Employment and Unemployment Statistics</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='color:blue'>Source: United States Department
of Labor</span></i></p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The Employment and Unemployment
statistics are from two major surveys, the Current Population Survey (CPS) and
the Current Employment Statistics survey (CES). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Current Population Survey (or
Household Survey) is a monthly survey of households conducted by the Bureau of
Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It provides a comprehensive body of
data on the labor force, employment, unemployment, persons not in the labor
force, hours of work, earnings, and other demographic and labor force
characteristics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Current Employment Statistics (or
Payroll Survey) is based on a survey of approximately 143,000 businesses and
government agencies representing approximately 588,000 worksites throughout the
United States. The primary statistics derived from the survey are monthly
estimates of employment, hours, and earnings for the Nation, States, and major
metropolitan areas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>Current Population Survey or
Household Survey</span></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>It is a sample survey of about 60,000 households
conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The sample is selected to reflect
the entire civilian non-institutional population. Based on responses to a
series of questions on work and job search activities, each person 16 years and
over in a sample household is classified as employed, unemployed, or not in the
labor force. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>Current Employment Statistics
or Payroll Survey</span></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>The sample establishments are drawn from private non-farm
businesses such as factories, offices, and stores, as well as Federal, State,
and local government entities. Employees on non-farm payrolls are those who
received pay for any part of the reference pay period, including persons paid
leave. Persons are counted in each job they hold. Hours and earnings data are
for private businesses and relate only to production workers in the
goods-producing sector and non-supervisory workers in the service-producing
sector.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>Current Population Survey or Household
Survey</span></b><span style='color:black'> </span><br>
<span style='color:black'>The survey is conducted by the US Census Bureau for
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Each month, during the calendar week including
the 19th day, Census interviewers contact households by telephone and in person
and ask questions regarding the labor market activity of household members
during the previous calendar week which included the 12th day of the month.
Personal visits are preferred in the first month in which the household is in
the sample. At the first visit, interviewers prepare a roster of the household
members including their demographic characteristics and their relationship to
the person maintaining the household, and enter the information via laptop
computers, along with responses to all survey questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>In the months following the first
interview, the interview is generally conducted by telephone. The household
roster is checked for accuracy and brought up to date in each interview. About
10 percent of households are interviewed via computer-assisted telephone
interviewing (CATI) by staff in three centralized calling centers. Other
telephone interviews are collected by field representatives. A personal visit
is generally attempted for the fifth interview. At the end of each day�s
interviewing, the data are transmitted over secure telecommunications lines to
the Census Bureau�s central computer in Washington, DC.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Under the estimating methods used
in the CPS, all of the results for a given month become available
simultaneously and are based on returns from all respondents. The estimation
procedure involves weighting the data from each sample person by the inverse of
the probability of the person being in the sample. This gives a rough measure
of the number of actual persons that the sample person represents. In the next
step, an adjustment is made to account for nonresponse. Then, ratio estimation
is done to bring the sample population distribution as closely into agreement
as possible with the known distribution of the entire population.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The seasonal adjustment procedure
that the CPS uses is X-12-ARIMA, which is based on moving averages or �filters�
that successively average a shifting timespan of data, which then provides
estimates of seasonal factors that change smoothly from one year to the next
year. The seasonal adjustment is done concurrently in that the program is run
monthly as new data come available.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>Current Employment Statistics
or Payroll Survey</span></b><span style='color:black'> </span><br>
<span style='color:black'>All new samples are solicited by computer-assisted
telephone interview (CATI) and data are collected for the first 5 months via
this mode. After the initiation period, many sample units are transferred to
one of several less costly reporting methods that are self-initiated by the
respondent. The CES offers responding businesses a choice of reporting modes in
an effort to maximize response rates within the program budget. Respondents can
report via Fax, Web, Touchtone Data Entry (TDE), Electronic Data Interchange
(EDI), or CATI.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>CES monthly employment estimates
are made using a two-part estimator. The sample reports are used to estimate
month-to-month employment change from continuing businesses and a birth/death
model is used to account for new firm births that otherwise would not be
sampled in a timely fashion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Sample-based estimator - CES uses
a matched sample concept and weighted link relative estimator to produce
employment, hours, and earnings estimates. For more information on these
methods and the CES sample-based estimator, see the Estimation Methods section
of the CES technical notes at www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cestn.htm#section5.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The sample alone is not sufficient
to estimate a total employment level because each month new firm births
generate employment growth, and there is an unavoidable lag between an
establishment opening for business, appearance on the sample frame, and availability
for inclusion. To account for these components of total employment, CES uses a
net business birth/death model.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>CES uses a concurrent seasonal
adjustment methodology, meaning that it incorporates estimates up through and
including the current month�s data to achieve the best possible series.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<h3>Definition(s)</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>Employed People</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>People are classified as employed if they did any
work at all as paid employees during the reference week; worked in their own
business profession, or on their own farm; or worked without pay at least 15
hours in a family business or farm. People are also counted as employed if they
were temporarily absent from their jobs because of illness, bad weather, vacation,
labor-management disputes, or personal reasons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>Unemployed People</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>People are classified as unemployed is they meet all
of the following criteria: They had no employment during the reference week;
they were available for work at that time; and they made specific efforts to
find employment sometime during the 4-week period ending with the reference
week. Persons laid off from a job and expecting recall need not be looking for
work to be counted as unemployed. The unemployment data derived from the household
survey in no way depend upon the eligibility for or receipt of unemployment
insurance benefits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>People Not in Labor Force</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>Those who are not classified as employed or
unemployed during the survey reference week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>Employment</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>Total number of persons on establishment payrolls
employed full- or part-time who received pay (whether they worked or not) for
any part of the pay period that includes the 12th day of the month.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<h3>Release Schedule</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>CES and CPS estimates are released
on the first Friday of each month.</span></p>

<h2>United States: New Residential Construction</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='color:blue'>Source: U.S. Department of
Commerce; and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span></i></p>

<h3>Objective</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The objective of the New
Residential Construction press release is to provide statistics on the starts, completions,
and characteristics of new, privately-owned single-family and multifamily
housing units and on sales of new single-family houses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>New Residential Construction data
includes various characteristics of new single-family houses completed, new
multifamily housing completed, new single-family houses sold, and new
contractor-built houses started. It also provides statistics on characteristics
of new privately-owned residential structures in the United States.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>Geographic Coverage</span></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>Statistics in the New Residential Construction
release are tabulated only for the United States and four Census Regions. The
SOC does not have a large enough sample size to make state or local area
estimates. The only series that is available at a smaller geographic area is
the housing units authorized by building permits. Building permit data are
collected from individual permit offices, most of which are municipalities; the
remainder are counties, townships, or New England and Middle Atlantic-type
towns. Since building permits are public records, local area data are available
without any confidentiality problems. From local area data, estimates are
tabulated for Counties, States, and Metropolitan Areas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>Housing Starts</span></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>The compilation of the housing starts series is a
multistage process. First, an estimate is made monthly of the number of housing
units for which building permits have been issued in all permit-issuing places
as described above.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Second, for each permit selected
in the 900 permit-issuing places, an inquiry is made of the owner or the
builder to determine in which month and year the unit(s) covered by the permit
was (was) started. In case the units authorized by permits in a particular
month are not started by the end of that month, follow-ups are made in
successive months to find out when the units were actually started.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Ratios are calculated (by type of
structure) of the number of units authorized by permits, based on the Building
Permits Survey to the number of units authorized by permits based on estimates
generated from the 900 SOC permit offices; separate ratios are calculated for
that month and the prior 11 months. The 13th through 18th month back are summed
and a ratio is calculated and all months from 19 months back through 60 months
(5 years) are summed to get another ratio. These ratios are then applied to the
appropriate estimate of the number of units started, based on the 900 SOC
permit offices, in the corresponding months or groups of months to provide
ratio adjusted estimates of the number of units started for each month or group
of months.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Adjustments are made to account
for those units started prior to permit authorization and for late reports.
These adjustments are based on historical patterns of pre-permit starts and
late data. No adjustment is made for units in permit areas built without a
permit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The estimates for housing units
started in permit-issuing places result from the procedures outlined above.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Third, units identified as started
in the monthly canvass of non-permit areas are weighted appropriately to
provide an estimate of total housing starts in areas not covered by building
permit systems. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Adding this estimate of starts in
non-permit areas to the estimate of starts in permit-issuing places results in
an estimate of total private housing units started.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>This same methodology is also used
for the estimates of housing units authorized but not started, under
construction, and completed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>This same methodology is also used
for the estimates of housing units authorized but not started, under
construction, and completed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>Housing Units Authorized by
Building Permits</span></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>Statistics are based upon reports submitted by local
building permit officials in response to a mail survey. Approximately 9,000 of
the 20,000 permit issuing places in the United States are surveyed monthly and
the remainder are surveyed annually. The data are obtained using &quot;Report
of New Privately-Owned Residential Building or Zoning Permits Issued.&quot;
When a report is not received, missing data are either (1) obtained from the
Survey of Use of Permits (SUP) which is used to collect information on housing
starts, or (2) imputed. Data for SUP are available only for about 900 places
for which Census Bureau field representatives list permits (see more
information below.) Imputations are based on the assumption that the ratio of
current month authorizations to those of a year ago should be the same for
reporting and nonreporting places.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>Housing Units Authorized, but
Not Started; Housing Starts; Housing Units Under Construction; and Housing
Completions</span></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>Estimates of Housing Units Authorized, but Not
Started; Housing Starts; Housing Units Under Construction; and Housing
Completions are all obtained from the Survey of Construction (SOC). SOC is
comprised of two parts: (1) Survey of Use of Permits (SUP) which estimates the
amount of new construction in areas that require a building permit and (2)
Nonpermit Survey (NP) which estimates the amount of new construction in areas
that do not require a building permit. Less than 3 percent of all new
construction takes place in nonpermit areas. Data from both parts of SOC are
collected by Census field representatives. For SUP they visit a sample of
permit offices and select a sample of permits issued for new housing. These
permits are then followed through to see when they are started, completed and
sold if the one-family unit was built to be sold. Each project is also surveyed
to collect information on characteristics of the structure. For NP, roads in
sampled nonpermit land areas are driven at least once every three months to see
if there is any new construction. Once new residential construction is found,
it is followed up the same as in SUP.</span></p>

<h3>Definition(s)</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>New Residential Construction</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>The category of statistics called &quot;New
Residential Construction&quot; consists of data on the five phases of a
residential construction project. This is housing units authorized to be built
by a building or zoning permit; housing units authorized to be built, but not
yet started; housing units started; housing units under construction; and
housing units completed. New residential construction statistics exclude group
quarters (such as dormitories and rooming houses), transient accommodations
(such as transient hotels, motels, and tourist courts), &quot;HUD-code&quot;
manufactured (mobile) homes, moved or relocated buildings, and housing units
created in an existing residential or nonresidential structure. However, in a
new building combing residential and nonresidential floor areas, every effort
is made to include the residential units in these statistics, even though the
primary function of the entire building is for nonresidential purposes. These
statistics only include privately-owned buildings. Publicly owned housing units
are excluded from the statistics. Units in structures built by private
developers with partial public subsidies or which are for sale upon completion
to local public housing authorities under the HUD &quot;Turnkey&quot; program
are all classified as private housing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>Housing Unit</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>A housing unit, as defined for purposes of this
report, is a house, an apartment, a group of rooms or a single room intended
for occupancy as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those
in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in the
building and which have a direct access from the outside of the building or
through a common hall. In accordance with this definition, each apartment unit
in an apartment building is counted as one housing unit. Housing units, as
distinguished from &quot;HUD-code&quot; manufactured (mobile) homes, include
conventional ``stick-built'' units, prefabricated, panelized, componentized,
sectional, and modular units. Housing unit statistics in these tables exclude
group quarters (such as dormitories and rooming houses), transient
accommodations (such as transient hotels, motels, and tourist courts),
&quot;HUD-code&quot; manufactured (mobile) homes, moved or relocated units, and
housing units created in an existing residential or nonresidential structure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>&quot;HUD-code&quot;
Manufactured (mobile) Homes</span></u></b><span style='color:black'><br>
A manufactured home is defined as a movable dwelling, 8 feet or more wide and
40 feet or more long, designed to be towed on its own chassis, with
transportation gear integral to the unit when it leaves the factory, and
without need of a permanent foundation. These homes are built in accordance
with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) building code.
Since these units are typically not covered by the building permits issued in
local municipalities, they are excluded from the New Residential Construction
statistics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>Building Permits</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>Statistics on housing units authorized by building
permits include housing units issued in local permit-issuing jurisdictions by a
building or zoning permit. Not all areas of the country require a building or
zoning permit. The statistics only represent those areas that do require a
permit. Current surveys indicate that construction is undertaken for all but a
very small percentage of housing units authorized by building permits. A major
portion typically gets under way during the month of permit issuance and most
of the remainder begins within the three following months. Because of this lag,
the housing unit authorization statistics do not represent the number of units
actually put into construction for the period shown, and should therefore not
be directly interpreted as &quot;housing starts.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>Housing Units Authorized,
but Not Started</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>Estimates of housing units authorized by a building
or zoning permit, but not yet started, are shown in the &quot;authorized, not
started&quot; data series. These only represent the areas of the country that
require a building or zoning permit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>Housing Starts</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>The start of construction is when excavation begins
for the footings or foundation of a building. All housing units in a
multifamily building are defined as being started when excavation for the
building has begun. Beginning with statistics for September 1992, estimates of
housing starts include units in residential structures being totally rebuilt on
an existing foundation. Housing starts are estimated for all areas of the
United States, regardless of whether permits are required.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>Housing Units Under
Construction</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>Estimates of housing units started, but not yet
completed, are shown in the &quot;under construction&quot; data series. Housing
units under construction are estimated for all areas of the United States,
regardless of whether permits are required.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>Housing Completions</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>One-unit structures are defined as completed when all
finished flooring has been installed. If the building is occupied before all
construction is finished, it is classified as completed at the time of
occupancy. In buildings with two or more housing units, all the units in the
building are counted as completed when 50 percent or more of the units are
occupied or available for occupancy. Housing completions are estimated for all
areas of the United States, regardless of whether permits are required.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>Multifamily Housing</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>Residential buildings containing units built one on
top of another and those built side-by-side which do not have a ground-to-roof
wall and/or have common facilities such as attic, basement, heating plant,
plumbing, etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>Residential Building</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>A residential building is a building consisting
primarily of housing units. In a new building combining residential and
nonresidential floor areas, every effort is made to include the residential
units in these statistics, even though the primary function of the entire
building is for nonresidential purposes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>Single-Family House</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>The single-family statistics include fully detached,
semidetached, row houses, and townhouses. In the case of attached units, each
must be separated from the adjacent unit by a ground-to-roof wall in order to
be classified as a single-family structure. Also, these units must not share
heating/air-conditioning systems or utilities, such as water supply, power
supply, or sewage disposal lines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<h3>Release Schedule</h3>

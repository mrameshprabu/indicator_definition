<h3><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:blue;font-weight:normal'>Source:
Philippine Statistics Authority </span></i></h3>

<h3><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></h3>

<h3><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Background</span></h3>

<h3><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:normal'>The Philippine Statistics
Authority National Statistics Office (NSO) became the sole agency to compile
foreign trade statistics starting in 1973. Prior to this period, The Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas also compiled and released foreign trade data. However,
the differences in the concepts used by these two agencies resulted to a
conflicting foreign trade data. This led to an agreement that sets PSA NSO to
be the sole compiler of the official foreign trade statistics.</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:black'>The Philippines adopts the &quot;General&quot; trade system of
recording foreign trade statistics. The customs frontier (not the national
boundary) is used as the statistical frontier. Under this system, all goods
entering any of the seaports or airports of entry of the Philippines properly
cleared through customs or remaining or under customs control are considered imports,
whether the goods are for direct consumption, for merchandising, for
warehousing or further processing. On the other hand, all goods leaving the
country, which are properly cleared through the Customs, are considered exports.
A distinction however, is made between export for goods grown, mined or
manufactured in the Philippines (domestic exports) and exports of imported
goods that do not undergo physical and/or chemical transformation in the
Philippines (re-exports).</span></p>

<h3><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Methodology</span></h3>

<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Sources of Information</span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Starting 2013 Export Revised FOB value, all
transactions that pass through all Value Added Service Providers (VASPs) of Bureau
of Customs (BOC) and Philippine Economic and Zone Authority (PEZA) were
included. Physical export declaration and electronic data files were the basis
of export statistics.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Commodity Classification</span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Starting with March 2007, analysis and tables
are based on the 2004 Philippine Standard Commodity Classification (PSCC)
groupings. This is in compliance with NSCB Resolution No. 03, Series of 2005
entitled �Approving and Adopting the 2004 Philippine Standard Commodity
Classification� by all concerned government agencies and instrumentalities.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Country of Origin</span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Country of Origin of an imported
commodity is the country where the commodity is grown, mined or manufactured.
Further processing or material added to it in another country must bring about
a material transformation to render such country as the country of origin. The
country of origin remains unchanged if the commodity is subjected to mere
sorting, grading, cleaning, packaging or similar processing.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Country of Destination</span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Country of Destination is the country of
ultimate destination/shipment. It is not necessarily the country where the
commodity/shipment is to be unloaded, as in the case of shipment unloaded from
one ocean liner but is destined to a country that is landlocked. In which case,
the country of destination is the landlocked country.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Valuation</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.8pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:9.6pt;
margin-left:0in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>Beginning with
1963, the rate of conversion for every independent transaction in computing the
FOB peso value are the actual rates appearing on entries or as reported in the
daily foreign exchange quotations of the BSP. Thus, there is no fixed rate
conversion for imports and exports since the actual rate fluctuates daily. For
imports, such variable rates have been used effective January 1963, whereas for
the first semester of 1963, the FOB value corresponding to the dollar receipts
derived from exports was computed by using the composite rate consisting of 80
percent at the free Market rate and 20 percent at the rate of two pesos to a
dollar. Starting with the second half of 1963, the rate conversion has been
changed to 100 percent free market rate. This latter procedure was adopted to
obtain a more realistic FOB peso value and to give a true picture of the
balance of trade position of the country.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.8pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:9.6pt;
margin-left:0in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>The Free on Board
(FOB) value is the value of the goods free on board the carrier at the frontier
of the exporting country. It includes inland freight, export duty and other
expenses. Ocean freight, insurance and consular fees, however, is excluded.
These FOB values are obtained directly from the source documents. However, for
cases where the FOB values declared in the source documents are not in US
dollars, these values are converted to US dollars. The average US dollar rate
for the month which is computed as the total daily rate of transactions divided
by the number of working days in a month is used in converting FOB value to FOB
US dollar value. For export, the average monthly dollar rate is multiplied by
0.9925 and for import, by 1.01 for adjustments. The dollar-peso average
exchange rate for the year in review is 54.67 for exports and 55.63 for
imports.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.8pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:9.6pt;
margin-left:0in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:black'>In addition,
valuation of goods in the Philippine Foreign Trade Statistics is FOB. However,
Cost-Insurance-Freight (CIF) valuation could also be determined as the data on
freight and insurance are available.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Processing</span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Data processing is done both mechanically and
manually. <br>
<br>
Copies of import and export documents collected by NSO personnel from the
customs houses in all ports of entry in the Philippines are systematically
controlled. Collected documents are sorted by month, by port, by single or
multiple commodity entries and by value. About 100 entries are assigned control
numbers and bundled together for the convenience of coders, computers and
encoders. The bundles then undergo the following stages of processing:</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>1) Coding - process of translating each item
of information to be culled into its equivalent alphabetic and/or&nbsp;numeric
code in accordance with the commodity, country, nationality of trader, flag or
registry of carrier of port classification used.<br>
<br>
2) Code Verification - process of determining the appropriateness of codes
used.<br>
<br>
3) Computation - process of converting the declared values appearing in the
entries into FOB value, insurance&nbsp;and freight in US dollars.<br>
<br>
4) Computation Verification - process of checking the accuracy of computed
data.<br>
<br>
Quality control of coding and computation for both imports and exports is
carried through sample verification. This method enables the verifier to decide
after a number of entries have been verified whether to reject, continue or
accept the bundle. The number and type of errors are recorded and brought to
the attention of the coder or computer. Further training is given on pinpointed
causes of errors of processors to improve the quality of their work.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Prior to 1982, encoding of data was done
directly onto CMC tapes. However, starting 1982, encoding is being made onto
diskettes. The data are then machine-sorted and machine-edited to determine the
accuracy and consistency of the information.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>After the necessary corrections are effected
on the erroneous figures, the monthly tabulations are finally produced. When
all monthly tabulations for a year have been completed the annual tabulations
are then prepared.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Documents received after the cut-off dates
for each month are accumulated, processed and the data are included in their
respective months at the end of the calendar year when the annual tabulations
are prepared.</span></p>

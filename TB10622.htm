<h2><b>United States: New Residential Sales</b></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='color:blue'>Source: U.S. Department of
Commerce; and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>Background</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>New residential sales provide national and regional data on
the number of new single-family houses sold and for sale including statistics
on median and average prices, the number of houses sold and for sale by stage
of construction, and other statistics. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Objective</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The objective of the New
Residential Sales press release is to provide statistics on the sales of new
privately-owned residential structures in the United States. </span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black;margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
     margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The number of new single-family houses sold; </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black;margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
     margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The number of new single-family houses for sale;
     and</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black;margin-top:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
     margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The median and average sales prices of new homes
     sold. Excluded from these estimates are &quot;HUD-code&quot; manufactured
     (mobile) home units.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>All statistics in the New
Residential Sales release are tabulated only for the United States and four
Census Regions. The SOC does not have a large enough sample size to make state
or local area estimates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:black'>New Home Sales</span></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>The compilation of the new home sales series was a
multistage process. First, an estimate was made monthly of the number of
housing units for which building permits were issued in all 19,000
permit-issuing places as described above. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Second, for each permit selected
in the 900 permit-issuing places, an inquiry was made of the owner or the
builder to determine if the house was already sold or was for sale. If already
sold, the month and year the house covered by the permit was sold was obtained.
In case the house authorized by a permit in a particular month was for sale,
follow-ups were made in successive months to find out when the unit was
actually sold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Ratios were calculated of the
number of houses sold to the number of houses covered by permits based on
estimates generated from the 900 SOC permit offices. Separate ratios were
calculated for houses sold from permits of that month and of each preceding
month for the past 7 years. These ratios, or sales rates, were then applied to
the appropriate estimate of the number of houses authorized by permits, based
on the Building Permits Survey, in the corresponding months to provide
estimates of the number of houses sold for each month of authorization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Having produced estimates of the
number of houses sold with permit authorization, two additional adjustments
were made. An upward adjustment of 3.3 percent was made to the number of houses
started to account for those units started within permit-issuing areas but
without permit authorization. (A study spanning a four year period during the
mid-1960s indicated that permits were obtained for all buildings with two
housing units or more.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The estimates for housing units
sold in the 19,000 permit-issuing places resulted from the procedures outlined
above. Third, units identified as sold in the monthly canvass of non-permit
areas were weighted appropriately to provide an estimate of total houses sold
in areas not covered by building permit systems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Adding this estimate of houses
sold in non-permit areas to the estimate of houses sold in the 19,000
permit-issuing places resulted in an estimate of total private houses sold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Adjustments were made to account
for those units sold prior to permit authorization and for late reports. These
adjustments were based on historical patterns of pre-permit sales and late
data. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Definition(s)</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>New Residential Sales</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>New residential sales estimates only include new
single-family residential structures. Sales of multi-family units are excluded
from these statistics. To be included in the sales estimates the sales
transaction must intend to include both the house and the land. All new houses
are not included in our new residential sales estimates; only houses sold prior
to being built or built for sale are included in these statistics. Excluded
from these estimates are houses built for rent, houses built by the owner, and
houses built by a general contractor on the owner's land.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>New Houses Sold</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>A house is considered sold when either a sales
contract has been signed or a deposit accepted. Included in our estimates are
houses for which a sales contract is signed or deposit accepted before
construction has actually started; for instance, houses sold from a model or
from plans before any work has started on the footings or foundations. These
estimates also include houses sold while under construction or after
completion. This survey does not follow through to the completion
(&quot;closing&quot;) of the sales transaction, so even if the transaction is
not finalized, the house is still considered sold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>New Houses For Sale</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>A house is considered for sale when a permit to build
has been issued in permit-issuing places or work has begun on the footings or
foundation in non-permit areas and a sales contract has not been signed nor a
deposit accepted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='color:black'>Sales Price</span></u></b><br>
<span style='color:black'>The sales price used in the survey is the price
agreed upon between purchaser and seller at the time the first sales contract
is signed or deposit made. It includes the price of the improved lot. The sales
price does not reflect any subsequent price changes resulting from change
orders or from any other factors affecting the price of the house. Furthermore,
the sales price does not include the cost of any extras or options paid for in
cash by the purchaser or otherwise not included in the original sales price
reported.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>The median sales price is the
sales price of the house which falls on the middle point of the total number of
houses sold. Half of the houses sold have a sales price less than the median
and half have a greater price.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Release Schedule</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='page-break-after:avoid'>New Residential Sales press
releases are issued on or about the 17th working day following the reference
month. </p>
